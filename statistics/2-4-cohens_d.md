[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohen's d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compaire to the difference in pregnancy length?

For first babies,

count    4363.000000
mean        7.201094
std         1.420573
min         0.125000
25%         6.437500
50%         7.312500
75%         8.000000
max        15.437500

For others,

count    4675.000000
mean        7.325856
std         1.394195
min         0.562500
25%         6.500000
50%         7.375000
75%         8.187500
max        14.000000
