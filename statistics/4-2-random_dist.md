[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF.  What goes wrong?

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

>> 
num = np.random.random(1000) <br>
pmf_np = thinkstats2.Pmf(num) <br>
cdf_np = thinkstats2.Cdf(num) <br>

>> thinkplot.Pmf(pmf_np, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random distribution', ylabel='PMF') <br>

>> thinkplot.Cdf(cdf_np)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random distribution', ylabel='CDF') <br>
